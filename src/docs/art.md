# Art
TinyBoxes are animated one-of-a-kind art pieces generated from the following traits. 

## Colors
### Root Color
The color palette is based on a user-selected root color in HSL format

HSL stands for Hue, Saturation and Lightness

Hue is a value from 0 to 360 degrees

Saturation and Lightness are both percentages from 0 to 100 

### Schemes
Color schemes are generated to complement your root color

Each scheme is a set of angle offsets from the root hue along the color wheel

This defines fixed relationships for the hues in a scheme

Complimenting hues are generated by adding these offsets to the root hue

### Schemes and their offset angles
- Triadic (0, 120, 240)
- Complimentary (0, 180)
- Tetradic (0, 60, 180, 240)
- Analogous (0, 30, 330)
- Analogous and Complimentary (0, 30, 180, 330)
- Split Complimentary (0, 150, 210)
- Complimentary and Analogous (0, 150, 180, 210)
- Series (0, 30, 60, 90)
- Square (0, 90, 180, 270)
- Mono (0)

### Gray Scale
A rare set of tokens with 0% saturation scattered throughout all schemes  

### Contrast
How wide a range of lightness to pick shades from

Defines a range of contrast relative to the root color for the color palette

### Shades

The number of lightness levels in a token's palette

Distributed in descending shades over the contrast range 

## Shapes
### Shape Count
The number of shapes in a TinyBox

### Hatching

Shapes divisible by the hatching modulus become tall and narrow or short and wide at a repeating interval

### Size Range
The range of width and height of shape sizes 

## Positioning
### Grid
The number of rows and columns that shapes are distributed accross

### Spread
How much the shapes positions may diverge from the grid 0-100%

## Mirroring
There are 3 Levels of mirroring

Each has four modes off, diagonal, opposite diagonal, and quad  

## Animation 

### Render Settings

Animation can be set to 8 different playback modes 
- Off
- On
- Hover
- Double Click / Click
- Click
- 1 Repeat
- 2 Repeats
- 25 Repeats

### Duration
The duration modifier allows you to adjust the length/speed of the animation
