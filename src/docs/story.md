# Story
A concept originally conceived at  ETH Denver 2020 by NateAlex, Tinyboxes began through collaboration driven by a shared interest in on-chain innovation.

Development began summer 2020 and continued the rest of the year. During that time we were working hard on developing our DAPP, perfecting the art, refining the experience, adding animations and reducing gas on mint.

In mid January 2021 we released a Beta on Rinkeby to get feedback and test the UX on our minting systems. This helped immensely in our pursuit of releasing the best project we could.

We launched TinyBoxes on January 29th 2021 to our awaiting community of collectors and beta testers. It was met with excitement and a warm reception from our and the broader on-chain community.

We discovered a bug in the on-chain renderer shortly after our launch. It prevented the "grow & shrink" animation from rendering. After looking at the contract we found an easy solution to the problem, redeployed the renderer and updated it in the main contract, fixing the "grow & shrink" animation.

On January 29th 2022 we celebrated the 1 Year Anniversary of TinyBoxes launch with a party in Cryptovoxels. We displayed some TinyBoxes, gave away LE tokens and wearables and reviewed the projects history in discord. All attendees who signed the guest list received an exclusive POAP for the event.
