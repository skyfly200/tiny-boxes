# FAQ

## What tech requirements?
A: A Modern Browser with the Metamask extension installed

## How do I retrieve my tokens art?
once verified, link to contract section, Etherscan contract read!

## Will my token look exactly like the preview?
No, there are generative algorithms that add small variations based on a random seed generated on mint. You cant predict the exact result just choose the region of the algo to explore. That suprise on minting is a big part of the fun of generative on-chain art!

## Can I choose the exact appearance of the token I mint?
Only by redeeming an LE token.

All standard tokens are rendered from a random seed selected when your token is born (the minting TX gets mined).

## What are LE tokens?
They are 100 limited edition tokens minted to those who have contributed to the project. There have been 72 minted as of July second, 2022

They can be redeemed once to design a TinyBox with setting including ones controlled by RNG with standard tokens.

They may be transferred in their unredeemed state.

## How can I get an LE token?
We give LE tokens to members of our community who make significant contributions to the TinyBox experience or sometimes as giveaways on Twitter and our Discord server.

The fist batch were minted to users of our beta release on rinkeby. Fearless beta testers on the testnets of ETH. Their feedback allowed us to release a far more polished and refined project for our public launch.
